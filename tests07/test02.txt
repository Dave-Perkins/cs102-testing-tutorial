Out of the huts of historys shame, I rise, up from a past that is rooted in pain, I rise, I am a black ocean, leaping and wide, welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear, I rise, into a daybreak that is wondrously clear, I rise, bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave, I rise, I rise, I rise.
